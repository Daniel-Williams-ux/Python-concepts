#HELLO WORLD
#Changing Numbers
#Variables that are assigned numeric values can be treated the same as the numbers themselves. 
#Two variables can be added together, divided by 2, and multiplied by a third variable without Python distinguishing between the variables 
#and literals (like the number 2 in this example). Performing arithmetic on variables does not change the variable — you can only update a variable using the = sign.

coffee_price = 1.50
number_of_coffees = 4
 
# Prints "6.0"
print(coffee_price * number_of_coffees)
# Prints "1.5"
print(coffee_price)
# Prints "4"
print(number_of_coffees)
 
# Updating the price 
coffee_price = 2.00
 
# Prints "8.0"
print(coffee_price * number_of_coffees)
# Prints "2.0"
print(coffee_price)
# Prints "4"
print(number_of_coffees)
#We create two variables and assign numeric values to them. Then we perform a calculation on them. 
#This doesn’t update the variables! When we update the coffee_price variable and perform the calculations again, they use the updated values for the variable!
